# Log Rotation
# Log File Creation:

# When you use RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=2000, backupCount=5), it starts by logging to the app.log file.
# Initially, this file is created(if it doesn't exist) and logs are written to it.
# When the Log File Reaches the Size Limit(maxBytes=2000):

# If the size of the app.log file exceeds 2000 bytes ( or the maxBytes threshold), it is "rolled over"â€”which means the current app.log file is archived and a new log file is created.
# By default, the rolled-over file is named something like app.log.1 (the .1 represents the first backup file).
# Backup Files:

# After the first rollover(when the size exceeds 2000 bytes), the original app.log file is archived as app.log.1 and a new app.log file is created for future logging.
# The backupCount = 5 means that a maximum of 5 backup log files will be kept. After 5 backups are created, the oldest log file will be deleted to make space for the newest one.
# The backup files are named sequentially(e.g., app.log.1, app.log.2, etc.). When a new file is rolled over, the existing backup files are renamed(e.g., app.log.1 becomes app.log.2, app.log.2 becomes app.log.3, and so on).
# Rolling Over and Deleting Old Logs:

# Once the file exceeds the size limit(2000 bytes), the log files will rotate. This means the old app.log gets renamed to app.log.1, and a new app.log starts fresh.
# If there are already 5 backup files(app.log.1 through app.log.5), the oldest file(e.g., app.log.5) will be deleted, and the new backup will take its place(i.e., app.log.1 will become app.log.2, and so on).
