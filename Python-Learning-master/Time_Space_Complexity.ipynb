    "Space Complexity of an algorithm denotes the total space used or needed by the algorithm for its working, for various input sizes. For example:\n",

    "vector<int> myVec(n);\n",
    "for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n",
    "    cin >> myVec[i]; \n",
    "In the above example, we are creating a vector of size n. So the space complexity of the above code is in the order of \"n\" i.e. if n will increase, the space requirement will also increase accordingly.\n",

    "Even when you are creating a variable then you need some space for your algorithm to run. All the space required for the algorithm is collectively called the Space Complexity of the algorithm.\n",

    "NOTE: In normal programming, you will be allowed to use 256MB of space for a particular problem. So, you can't create an array of size more 10^8 because you will be allowed to use only 256MB. Also, you can't create an array of size more than 10^6 in a function because the maximum space allotted to a function is 4MB. So, to use an array of more size, you can create a global array."

    "Sometimes, there are more than one way to solve a problem. We need to learn how to compare the performance different algorithms and choose the best one to solve a particular problem. While analyzing an algorithm, we mostly consider time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Similarly, Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.\n",
