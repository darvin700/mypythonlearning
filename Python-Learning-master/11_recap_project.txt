Mini Project: Student Record Management System
This mini-project simulates a basic Student Record Management System.
It allows users to perform operations like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student records. The project demonstrates the use of Python concepts such as:

Strings: To handle student names and IDs.
Lists: To store multiple student records.
Dictionaries: To represent individual student records with details like name, age, and grades.
Tuples: For immutable operations, like storing predefined menu options.
File Handling: To save and load student records.
Functions: To modularize the code into reusable components.
Loops and If-Else Conditions: For navigation and logic implementation.
