Python Program to Count the Number of Vowels Present in a String using Sets

================================
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()" Output: true Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}" Output: true Example 3:

Input: s = "(]" Output: false Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]" Output: false Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}" Output: true

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104 s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
