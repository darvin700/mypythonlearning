    "## Mini Project: You will play with your computer by selecting characters from {Tom, Jerry, Spike}\n",
    "## In Tom and Jerry TV serial: There are always something happening among Tom (Cat), Jerry (Mouse) and Spike (Bulldog).\n",
    "#... at some time one character is winning and another time different character is winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let we are making a simple python code: In this code you will play game with your computer.\n",
    "#... You are going to select one of the character from the list (Tom, Jerry, Spike). Computer will also select one of the character but randomnly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## And the rule of the winning is as following:\n",
    "#... 1. Spike (dog) beats the Tom (cat), 2. Tom (cat) beats the Jerry (mouse), 3. Jerry (mouse) beats the Spike (dog), 4. Ties, if both selected the same character.\n",
    "#... Example: if you selected \"Spike\" and computer selected \"Tom\" => You won the game => You beat the Computer. You can try again to win by the above rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to play: Just run the code and enter the values they ask for. There is option to quit the game."
